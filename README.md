This project aims to develop a Digital Communications Web Application that allows users to perform private and encrypted one-to-one audio and video calls, manage call recordings, replay past communications, and interact via voice notes.

The project follows the Agile Methodology, and development is divided into Sprints with continuous delivery and testing. Each functionality is defined as a User Story, which is then broken down into Functional Requirements (FRs).
